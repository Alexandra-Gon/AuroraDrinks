            The history of the cocktail has its beginnings in the 18th century.
            At that time, it was a drink that consisted of mixing spirits
            (usually vodka) with other ingredients. The mixture of different
            types of alcohol gave it a unique and exclusive flavor that no other
            alcoholic beverage had. So with time it spread until today. Nowadays
            cocktail recipes can have many alcoholic beverages, they can be
            based on gin, vodka, rum, whiskey, cava, wine... Nowadays there is a
            great variety of cocktails and variations of these, you are ready to
            know them.<br/><br/>

          "Cocktail" where does the word come from?

            The origin of the word Cocktail is somewhat controversial. There are
            many theories of where the name came from but it is not entirely
            clear. In English "Cock" is cock and "Tail" is tail. One of the
            theories says that a waitress in a tavern in New York, stirred
            cocktails with a cock tail feather, and that is where the name
            cocktail comes from. On the other hand, it is said that it was an
            invention of a Frenchman, who sarcastically used a word in French
            and another in English, since Coq is also French for rooster.
            Another theory says that doctors used to cure sore throats by
            applying alcohol to the throat of their patients with a rooster
            feather dipped in alcohol. And some other theories are also floating
            around, in short, it is not entirely clear where the word cocktail
            comes from.<br/><br/>
